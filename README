Berserk is a Scrum tracking tool developed to track sprint backlog, integrating
with Bugzilla or FogBugz to track these tasks.

The workflow of Berserk is heavily influenced by Overlord and Flux developed by
Medsphere.


To install:

 * Make sure your berserk checkout directory is actually named berserk2.

 * pip install
    - django
    - mysql-python
    - simplejson
    - beautifulsoup
    - twill (for Bugzilla Novell backend only)

 * Copy local_settings.py.in to local_settings.py.  Configure your settings in
   local_settings.py.  Make sure to list your database settings, which bug
   tracker you want to use, and if you plan to use timeline, your email
   settings.

 * python manage.py syncdb && python manage.py migrate
    - If you are testing locally with sqlite, the migrations are known to fail.
      In this case, disable south and fake migrations by using this command:

      python manage.py syncdb --all && python manage.py migrate --fake

      If you keep this database between migrations, you will need to perform
      any new migrations manually. Using mysql even for testing is usually
      easier.

 * Set up berserk in your webserver or for development:

     python manage.py runserver

To configure:

 * Navigate to berserk's admin page in your browser.  If you are running in
   development mode, this is at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin.

 * Configure the default site to point to where Berserk is located on the
   internet.  In development mode, using http://127.0.0.1:8000 is a-ok.

 * Configure your first bug tracker, providing the product (or in FogBugz
   terms, a project), the base url and login credentials.

 * If you plan to run in production, install the crontab configuration located
   in conf/crontab.  If you're running in development mode, you'll need to run
   the management commands manually when you want fresh data.
